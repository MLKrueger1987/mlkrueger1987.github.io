            <h2>Education and Background</h2>
            <p>I have a B.A. in Psychology, a Juris Doctorate, and a M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech with a specialization in Machine Learning. I spent three years founding and running my own web-based law practice and legal tech firm before returning to school to pursue Computer Science. I enrolled in Georgia Tech's M.S. in 2016 and graduated in 2018.</p>
            <h2>An attorney in tech?</h2>
            <p>A legal education and experience is suprisingly well suited for work in tech. If you are like me, you are surprised. I certainly did not expect many of the skills I developed in my years of legal practice to be of use when I transitioned. However, as I studied, read, interacted with professors and other developers and data sciencetist--some with similar legal backgrounds to mine--I found that I was well equiped for many of the challenges that developers and engineers deal with regularly.</p>
            <p>The critical 'soft' skills in Tech and Data Science are the skills that are trained and honed in legal practice and study. Communication is key in law. A failure to effectively communicate will almost always lead to failure in the practice of law. You also need to be able to extract the requirements of clients and be able to turn them into actionable techinal specifications. If you run your own practice, or are working in a small one, you are constantly juggling multiple projects with different deadlines and priorities. Each new case brings new things you need to understand and learn. This means digging through case law and statutes. Interesting, statutes and documentation are often layout in similar ways. If you can effectively dig through documentation, you can probably dig through a statute pretty well too.  The 'soft' skills in tech are essentially <strong><i>the</i></strong> skills in law.</p>
            <h2>Ok, but Data Science?</h2>
            <p>Data Science and Law are both driven by deliverables. In Data Science, we are trying to take raw data and answer specific questions or address particular problems. Essentially, we are trying to bring something of value from soup of data. The difference between a solution that sizzels or fizzels often comes down to selecting the right tool. Law is similar. We need to deliver a legal solution based on the facts at hand. Just because some new approach is sexier and it the 'in' thing, it does not mean it is the right one. Selecting the wrong tool can be one of the fastest roads to failure in the legal feild.</p>
            <p>
            Similarly, Law and Data Science also both often involve explaining highly technical information and solutions to non-technical stake holders. Just think about sigining a lease or, worse, a mortgage. They are filled with a ton of 'legalease' and technical information that, without some background, is simply noise. In both feilds it is critical that we can explain the solutions we have found, the limitations we have discovered, or the options available in simiple, audience approriate, terms. Without this ability, the best solutions in both law and Data Science may never be realized.
            </p>
            <p>
            Precision matters in both Law and Data Science. A solution that is not tailored correctly to the problem at hand can often be worse than the problem was in the first place. In both fields, we need to directly address the problem that is being presented, not the problem we <i>think</i> is being presented. Communication and precision is key. Getting to the heart of a problem with the right questions and follow up allows us to tailor and deliver a solution that directly address the problem head on.
