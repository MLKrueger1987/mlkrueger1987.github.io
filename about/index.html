            <p>I have a B.A. in Psychology, a Juris Doctorate, and a M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech with a specialization in Machine Learning. I spent three years founding and running my own web-based law practice and legal tech firm before returning to school to pursue Computer Science. I enrolled in Georgia Tech's M.S. in C.S. through their OMSCS program in 2016 and graduated in 2018.</p>
            <p>I am currently consulting but am looking for full time opportunities. If you have something that you feel I would be a good fit for, connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewlkrueger/">LinkedIn</a> and send me a message.</p>
            <p>A number of people are surprised by my background. There are not a lot of attorneys in Machine Learning and Data Science. As a result, most people are not aware of the skills that experience in the legal field brings. If you are curious about this, <a href="/about/attorney_in_ml">An Attorney in DS and ML</a> is something I put together to give a bit of a run down on why this combination is actually a good one.</p>
