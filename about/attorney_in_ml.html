            <h2>An attorney in tech?</h2>
            <p>First, I don't view myself as an attorney doing Data Science and Machine Learning. Its more accurate to think of me as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with significant domain knowledge in the Law and Ethics domain. However, I understand that--for many--I am seen as attorney first. So, let me explain why that is a plus.</p> 
            <p>A legal education and experience is surprisingly well suited for work in tech. If you are like me, you are surprised. I certainly did not expect many of the skills I developed in my years of legal practice to be of use when I transitioned. However, as I studied, read, interacted with professors and other developers and data scientist--some with similar legal backgrounds to mine--I found that I was well equipped for many of the challenges that developers and engineers deal with regularly.</p>
            <p>The critical 'soft' skills in Tech and Data Science are the skills that are trained and honed in legal practice and study. Communication is key in law. A failure to effectively communicate will almost always lead to failure in the practice of law. You also need to be able to extract the requirements of clients and be able to turn them into actionable technical specifications. If you run your own practice, or are working in a small one, you are constantly juggling multiple projects with different deadlines and priorities. Each new case brings new things you need to understand and learn. This means digging through case law and statutes. Interesting, statutes and documentation are often layout in similar ways. If you can effectively dig through documentation, you can probably dig through a statute pretty well too.  The 'soft' skills in tech are essentially <strong><i>the</i></strong> skills in law.</p>
            <h2>Ok, but Data Science?</h2>
            <p>Data Science and Law are both driven by deliverables. In Data Science, we are trying to take raw data and answer specific questions or address particular problems. Essentially, we are trying to bring something of value from soup of data. The difference between a solution that sizzles or fizzles often comes down to selecting the right tool. Law is similar. We need to deliver a legal solution based on the facts at hand. Just because some new approach is sexier and it the 'in' thing, it does not mean it is the right one. Selecting the wrong tool can be one of the fastest roads to failure in the legal field.</p>
            <p>
            Similarly, Law and Data Science also both often involve explaining highly technical information and solutions to non-technical stake holders. Just think about signing a lease or, worse, a mortgage. They are filled with a ton of 'legalese' and technical information that, without some background, is simply noise. In both fields it is critical that we can explain the solutions we have found, the limitations we have discovered, or the options available in simple, audience appropriate, terms. Without this ability, the best solutions in both law and Data Science may never be realized.
            </p>
            <p>
            Precision matters in both Law and Data Science. A solution that is not tailored correctly to the problem at hand can often be worse than the problem was in the first place. In both fields, we need to directly address the problem that is being presented, not the problem we <i>think</i> is being presented. Communication and precision is key. Getting to the heart of a problem with the right questions and follow up allows us to tailor and deliver a solution that directly address the problem head on.
