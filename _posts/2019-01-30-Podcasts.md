Recently, I have found myself being pushed to learn more through podcasts. I have never really been a podcast guy. I would subscribe to ones I thought might be interesting, but would never actually listen to them. Recently, that changed.

A few months ago I came across an article--I do not remeber where now--that mentioned a few Data Science and Machine Learning podcasts. The two that have really stuck with me are: This Week in Machine Learning and AI [TWIMLAI](https://twimlai.com/) and [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/)
